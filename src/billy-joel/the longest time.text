Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest
If you say goodbye to me tonight
There would still be music left to write
What else could i dooo
I'm so inspired by youu
I haven't been there for the looongest time
I haven't been there for the looongest time
I haven't been there for the looongest time
I haven't been there for the looongest time
